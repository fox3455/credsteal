W.I.P.

This is a simple bash script. This opens airodump-ng to grab traffic on open networks. This will also boot into analysis for the data using URLSnarf.

This program will: 
Set wifi device into monitor mode
Auto log traffice into pcap file
Log for 4 minutes

=======================
To Do List:
1.) Add in ctrl c or other automated stop feature to close airodump-ng
2.) Add in URLsnarf command to auto filter traffic
3.) Speed up script/clean up code
4.) Allow user to pass arg for time duration on scan
5.) Split time duration for the purpose of progress bar
=========================

This is for educational purposes only and should not be used on networks you do not explicitly own or have permission to operate in within this capacity.
